%this script aims to geterate a population of valid environments and then allow finding a way to efficiently
%generate valid M (coupling) matrices for testing environments. These environments are composed of sets of
%spiral-plannar coils disposed along cubic spaces of different side values. We employ random-direction mobility
%model.
